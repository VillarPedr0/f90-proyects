# Fortran Quadratic Root Calculator
This Fortran program is designed to calculate the real roots of a quadratic function of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. Given the coefficients a, b, and c, the program efficiently computes the real roots, accounting for various cases such as no real roots, a single real root, or two distinct real roots.
